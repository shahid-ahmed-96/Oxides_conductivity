# Thermal conductivity of Oxides
**Note:**<br>
This is part of an introductory class to Material Informatics. All three of us had no prior knowledge of Machine Learning. For creation of the project we utilized the following steps:

### Data Collection:
We used Matminer to extract properties for oxides from AFLOW database. Oxides were chosen for their relative low thermal conductivity.
We did a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to ensure overfitting was avoided. Also plotted a pie chart that helped remove outlier oxides. (Bravais Lattices that were less than 2% of the total number of oxides). Heat maps validated the PCA results.
